  <h1>Turing Coding Challenge 02</h1>
  <h3>Divisibility Challenge</h3>
  <h4>Date taken: 07/06/2024</h4>
  <h5>Result: FAIL</h6>
    <p>
      <b>Challenge Task:</b>
    </p>
    <p>Imagine you have a collection of integers in a list, along with two fixed parameters,limit and divisor. Your task
      is to determine the quantityt of unique contiguous sublists,which contain a maximum of "limit" elements divisible
      by "divisor".</p>

    <p>Two sublists, list1 and list2, are recognized as independente if:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>They contain a diferente quantity of elements; or</li>
      <li>There's at leas a single position, i, where list1[i] isn't equivalente to list2[i]</li>
    </ol>

    <p>A sublist is identified as na uninterrupted sequence of elements in a list that isn't empty.</p>

    <p><b>Example 1:</b></p>
    <p>
      Input list = [6,9,9,6,6], limit = 3, divisor = 3<br />
      Output: 9<br />
      Explanation:<br />
      Every element in the list is divisible by the divisor=3. As per our task constraints, we can only have a maximum
      of
      "limit" = 3 elements divisible by 3 within any sublist.<br />
      The 9 unique subslists which satisfy these conditions are: [6], [6,9], [6,9,9], [9,9,6], [9,6], [9,6,6], [9,9],
      [9]
      and [6,6].<br />
      Each sublist is unique and has at most "limit" = 3 elements divisible by 3.</p>

    <p><b>Example 2:</b></p>
    <p>
      Input list = [5, 10, 15, 20], limit = 4, divisor = 6<br />
      Output: 10<br />
      Explanation:<br />
      Every element in the list is divisible by the divisor = 5. Any sublist will have at most 4 elements that are
      divisible by 5. Because of this, there are 10 sublists that fulfill the conditions.</p>

    <p><b>Constraints:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>The length of the list is between 1 and 200, inclusive;</li>
      <li>The elements of the list and the divisor are between 1 and 200, inclusive.</li>
      <li>The limit is less than or equal to the length of the list.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Playground</h3>
    <div>
      List: [<input type="text" id="listInput" value="6,9,9,6,6" />]
    </div>
    <div>
      Limit:
      <input type="number" min=1 max=200 step=1 id="limitInput" value="3" />
    </div>
    <div>
      Divisor:
      <input type="number" min=1 max=200 step=1 id="divisorInput" value="3" />
    </div>
    <button onclick="findSublists();">Find Subslists</button>
    <div>
      Result: <span id="result"></span>
    </div>
    <div id="errorsDiv" style="display: none; color:red">
      Error: <span id="error"></span>
    </div>
    <p>The values above are from example # 1. You can try inputting the values from example # 2.</p>
    <p>Another known-answer example is the given test case:</p>
    <p>
      Input list = [2, 3, 3, 2, 2], limit = 2, divisor = 2<br />
      Expected Output: 11<br />
